Munki-Bootstrap
===============

This package will make a Munki client download everything from the server and install it, rebooting if necescary.

The Makefile needs [The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage) to build the package.

Praise be to those amazing chaps over at the [Munki project](http://code.google.com/p/munki/) for building this kind of functionality in!
